### 1. Data Visualisation - World Population Infographics

This is a demonstration of plotly data visualisation in jupyter notebook with world population data throughout years.

It is a known fact that the world population is growing in an accelerating manner. The growing population in different are in the world may lead to certain severe consequences, such as food shortage, unaffordable housing prices, or medical services failure. Therefore, it is worthy to see which part of the world has a growing population and how the profile of the population is changing. In this project, some infographics are created with python using the graph plotting module ‘plotly’.

### 2. Classification - Mobile Price

This project is dealing with a Kaggle dataset in the following link:<br>
https://www.kaggle.com/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification<br>
It contains the differnt features of differnt models of phone and their respective price range. A simple demonstration of training a Random Forest Classifier to predict the price ranges of phones is included, and the the classifier achieves an accuracy of around <b>90%</b>, which is a <b>~10% improvement</b> compare to the baseline model (Random forest classifier with default parameters).
